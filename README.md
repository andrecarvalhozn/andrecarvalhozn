### Hello there! my name is AndrÃ© an I'm a soon-to-be graduate diving into the world of tech after studying Computer Science at CESAR School. I'm all about creation and exploration on the web, especially when it comes to front-end magic using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

###  Throughout my time in university, I found myself in a continuous process to polish my skills, crafting useful and user-friendly websites. But besides the front end part â€“ I'm a huge enthusiast for Java and Python, and I'm always excited about the possibilities of what you could achieve using them.
